# Code samples

The Quix Portal includes Quix Code Samples, a collection of templates and sample projects that you can use to start working with the platform.

Quix allows you to explore the Code Samples and save them as a new project and immediately run or deploy them. If you don't have a Quix account yet, go [sign-up to Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=docs){target=_blank} and create one.

The backend of the Code Samples is handled by a public [Open source repository](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target=_blank} on GitHub. You can become a contributor of our Code Samples by generating new samples or updating existing ones.
