# Personal access token (PAT)

Personal Access Tokens, or PATS, are bearer tokens that can be used to authenticate the various Quix APIs, such as the Portal API.

To obtain a PAT, log in to the Quix Portal, and click `Settings` in the main left-hand navigation. Then click `APIs and tokens`.

In the `APIs and tokens` dialog, you can click `Personal Access Tokens` to generate PATs, or a Streaming Token for use with the Quix Streams client library.
