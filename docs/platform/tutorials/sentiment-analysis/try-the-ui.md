# Try the UI

!!! tip

    In the pipeline view, you can always determine a topic name by hovering over the connecting line that represents that topic. You can also click the connecting line, to see its name, and optionally to jump to the Data Explorer to view live data for the topic.

Now try out the UI you just deployed. To do this:

1. In the pipeline view find the UI service tile, as shown in the following screenshot:

2. In the service tile, click the external link icon to launch the UI in a new tab:

3. Enter your username (it can be anything) and then type in some messages. Note that the typing indicator displays the sentiment as you type your message.

4. Type various messages and check the sentiment is as expected. Also note that the sentiment analysis is shown in the real-time graph display.

5. Select a different source from the `Message source` dropdown, and observe the messages and corresponding sentiment analysis graph change in real time.
