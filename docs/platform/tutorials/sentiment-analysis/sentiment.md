# 2. Sentiment Analysis

In [Part 1](chat-app.md) you deployed a Chat App UI, sent some messages and maybe used your phone or sent the link to a friend or colleague and you saw messages being displayed in the Chat UI in real-time.

Now it's time to analyze the sentiment of the conversation by adding a new node to the processing pipeline.

## 2. Evaluating sentiment

Follow these steps to deploy the sentiment analysis pipeline stage.

1. Navigate to the Library and locate `Sentiment analysis` transformation.

2. Click `Edit code`

3. Click `Save as project`
    
    - The code for this transformation is now saved to your workspace

4. Locate main.py

5. Locate the line of code that creates the output stream
    
    ``` python
    output_stream=output_topic.create_stream(input_stream.stream_id)
    ```

6. Append `-output` to the stream id.
    
    - This will ensure the Web UI is able to locate the sentiment being output by this transformation service.
    
    ``` python
    output_stream=output_topic.create_stream(input_stream.stream_id + "-output")
    ```

## Deploy the service

1. Click the `+tag` button at the top of any code file

2. Enter `v1` and press enter

3. Click `Deploy` near the top right corner

4. In the deployment dialog, select `v1` under the `Version Tag`
    
    - This is the tag you just created

5. Click `Service` in `Deployment Settings`
    
    - This ensures the service runs continuously

6. Click `Deploy`
    
    - This service subscribes to data from the `messages` topic and publishes to the `sentiment` topic.
    
    - You can now once again go to the Web UI project you deployed in [Part 1](chat-app.md). 
    
    - Enter values for `Room` and `Name` and click `CONNECT`.
        
    - You can now enter `chat` messages and see the sentiment being updated each time a message is posted.

            The sentiment analysis service you just deployed will subscribe to the `messages` topic. The sentiment is returned to the Web UI via the `sentiment` topic and displayed both in the chart and next to the comment in the chat window by colorizing the chat userâ€™s name.
