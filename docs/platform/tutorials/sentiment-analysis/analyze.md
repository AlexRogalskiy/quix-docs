# 2. Analyze

In [Part 1](chat-app.md) you deployed a Chat App UI, sent some messages and maybe used your phone or sent the link to a friend or colleague and you saw messages being displayed in the Chat UI in real-time.

Now it's time to analyze the sentiment of the conversation by adding a new node to the processing pipeline. This will utilize a prebuilt model from [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/){target=_blank} to analyze the sentiment of each message flowing through the microservice.

The microservice subscribes to data from the `messages` topic and publishes sentiment results to the `sentiment` topic.

The code you're about to build gets the job done and meets the needs of this tutorial. However, it is by no means production ready.

## Evaluating sentiment

The sentiment of each message will be evaluated by this new microservice in your message processing pipeline.

Follow these steps to deploy the prebuilt microservice:

1. Navigate to the Library and search for `Sentiment analysis`

2. Click `Setup & deploy`

5. Ensure the "input" is set to `messages`

    This is the topic that is subscribed to for messages to analyze

6. Ensure the "output" is set to `sentiment`

    This is the topic that sentiment results are published to

6. Click `Deploy`

7. You can once again go to the Web UI project you deployed in [Part 1](chat-app.md). 

9. Enter values for `Room` and `Name` and click `CONNECT`.

10. Now enter chat messages and see the sentiment being updated in real-time each time a message is posted.

    !!! info
        The sentiment analysis service you just deployed will subscribe to the `messages` topic. The sentiment is returned to the Web UI via the `sentiment` topic and displayed both in the chart and next to the comment in the chat window by colorizing the chat userâ€™s name.

	You have added to the pipeline by building and deploying a microservice to analyze the chat messages in real-time
