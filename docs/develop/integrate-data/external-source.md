# Using an external source

One simple way to write data into a Quix topic, is to use the prebuilt connector called `External source`. 

To add an external source:

1. Go to the pipeline view.
2. Click `+ New` in the top right corner of the view.
3. Select `External source`.
4. In `Output` select the topic you are going to publish to, or add a new topic with `+ Add new`. 
5. In `Name` type any suitable name, such as "Laptop CPU Load".
6. Click `Add external source`.

The external source now appears in the pipeline view as a reminder (visual cue) as to the nature of the source generating the data for this topic.
