# Project templates

Project templates provide a way for you to examine your use case running in Quix. You don't need to sign up to see these projects running in Quix.

Project templates also provide a starting point for your own projects - our project templates are hosted as open source in the [Quix GitHub repository](https://github.com/quixio), so you can fork them and import them into Quix, and use them to build out your own solution.
