# Add a source

Now create a sample application. In this case you'll first add a data source. In your project directory enter the following command:

```
quix local app create 
```

You will be prompted to select a library item using the interactive menu. Select `Source` and then `Demo Data`. This will give you a source that generates F1 racing car data from a CSV file. Give the application a suitable name, such as `F1 demo data`.
