# Welcome

<p style="font-size: 1rem;">Quix is a complete platform for developing, deploying, and monitoring stream processing pipelines. You develop your pipeline services in Python, and deploy them to containers managed in Kubernetes with a single click. You can develop and manage services on the command line, and also manage and visualize your pipelines in Quix Cloud.</p>
