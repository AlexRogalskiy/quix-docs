# Welcome

<p style="font-size: 1rem;">Quix is a complete platform for developing, deploying, and monitoring stream processing pipelines. You develop your <b>pipeline services in Python</b> using Quix Streams, and deploy them to containers managed in Kubernetes with a single click. You can develop and manage services on the command line, and also manage and visualize your pipelines in Quix Cloud.</p>

Your Quix workflow:

1. Develop your applications locally in Python with Quix Streams and the Quix CLI
2. Test your pipeline locally with Quix CLI
3. Deploy to Quix Cloud for scalability and observability
