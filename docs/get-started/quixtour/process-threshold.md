# Process - threshold detection

In this part of the tour you'll learn how to create a transform. The transform detects if CPU load exceeds a certain threshold, and if so, sends a dataframe to its output topic.

## Create the transform

To create the threshold detection transform:

1. In your `Develop` environment, click on `Code Samples` in the main left-hand navigation. 
2. Select the `Python`, `Transformation`, and `Basic templates` filters.
3. For `Starter transformation` click `Preview code`.
4. Click `Edit code`.
5. Name the transform "CPU Threshold".
6. Select the input topic `cpu-load`.
7. For the output topic, add a new topic called `cpu-spike`.
8. In the project view click on `main.py` to edit it.
9. Replace all the code in `main.py` with the following:

    ``` python
    import os
    from quixstreams import Application
    from quixstreams.models.serializers.quix import JSONDeserializer, JSONSerializer

    def threshold_detect(row):
        if row['CPU_Load'] > 20:
            print ('CPU spike: ', row['CPU_Load'])
            return row
        else:
            return None

    app = Application.Quix("threshold-transform", auto_offset_reset="latest")
    input_topic = app.topic(os.environ["input"], value_deserializer=JSONDeserializer())
    output_topic = app.topic(os.environ["output"], value_serializer=JSONSerializer())

    sdf = app.dataframe(input_topic)
    sdf = sdf.apply(threshold_detect)
    sdf = sdf.filter(lambda row: row != None)
    sdf = sdf.update(lambda row: print(row))
    sdf = sdf.to_topic(output_topic)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(sdf)    
    ```

11. Tag the project as `process-v1` and deploy as a service.
12. Monitor the logs for the deployed process.

    ??? example "Understand the code"

        There is a simple function, `threshold_detect` that examines a row, inspects the CPU load, and if it exceeds the threshold prints a message and returns a row, or in the case where there is no CPU spike, returns `None` (the `else` is just added to make this explicit).

        Rows with a value of `None` are then filtered from the stream, before the row is published to the output topic.

        The outcome is that only events where the CPU load threshold is exceeded are published to the output, for further processing in the next stage of the pipeline. 


## Generate a CPU spike

You can generate a CPU spike by starting up several CPU intensive applications. In the logs you will see a message similar to the following when a spike is detected:

```
CPU spike: 71%
```
