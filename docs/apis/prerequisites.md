# Prerequisites

To use the APIs you'll typically need the following:

1. [Sign up to Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up).

2. Obtain a [Personal Access Token](../platform/how-to/personal-access-token-pat.md) - you need this to authenticate requests.

3. [Find out how to get your environment ID](../platform/how-to/get-environment-id.md) - you need this for request URLs.

4. Obtain the [API references](api-references.md).

Useful information can also be found in the settings panels for your environment:

1. Click `Settings` in the bottom left corner of the Quix portal.

2. From `Project settings` select the environment you are working with.

3. Click `APIs and tokens`.

You are now presented with a very useful panel. From here you have useful links to items such as API documentation (rendered with Swagger), as well as your Personal Access Tokens (PATs):
