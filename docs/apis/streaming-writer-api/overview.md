# Overview

The Streaming Writer API enables you to stream data into a Quix topic using HTTP endpoints or Microsoft's [SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr){target=_blank} technology. You can use the Streaming Writer API from any language or web client with an HTTP (REST) or WebSockets interface. 

Streaming Writer API is typically used by clients written in languages not supported by Quix Streams (which supports Python only), or by other web services and clients that need to publish data to Quix.
