# How to replay data

!!! danger "Legacy feature"

	This feature is not available to new users. However, legacy users may still have access to this functionality.

Quix features a **replay service**. This service enables you to replay persisted data into a topic, as if it were live data. This is very useful for the following use cases:

* Testing and debugging connectors and transforms
* [Stream reprocessing](https://quix.io/blog/intro-stream-reprocessing-python/?x-craft-preview=VDVjwJTquq&token=7oGSdC9yxYk0zECNUz2RtzJLtGqG-aZB){target=_blank}
* Testing and retraining ML models

Once you have persisted data, it is possible to set up a replay service in your pipeline. Rather than using the live source of data, you can replay the persisted data into a topic in your pipeline, and monitor the processing. 

It is possible to configure the replay in various ways, for example:

* You can edit the destination topic. This means you can play back the same persisted data into different topics for testing and debugging.
* You can replay the data at the original speed or at maximum speed.
* You can replay the data with either the original timestamps, or simulated timestamps. The simulated timestamps are based on present time, rather than the original timestamps.

Once created, a replay service looks like any other service in your pipeline, and you can play or pause the streaming of data as required.

## To replay persisted data into a topic

You can only replay persisted data, so you need to persist a topic first. In your Quix environment, select `Topics` in the left-hand sidebar to list all your topics. Ensure the topic you want to persist has persistence switched on, as shown in the following screenshot:

![Enable persistence](../images/replay/replay-add-persist-topic.png)

Click `Pipeline` in your Quix environment, and then to create a new replay, click `Add new` in the top right corner:

![Add replay](../images/replay/replay-add-new.png)

Then select the `Replay` menu item. This displays the `Add replay` wizard. 

Select the topic with persisted data you want to replay from (only topics with persisted data will be shown), then select the stream whose data you want to replay:

![Replay select stream](../images/replay/replay-select-stream.png)

Then click `Next`.

Now configure your replay according to your use case. For example, you can retain the dataâ€™s original timestamps, or select simulated timestamps for timestamps based on the present time. You also need to select the output topic (the topic the data is played into):

Once you have completed your configuration, click `Add replay`.

Switch to `Pipeline` view. The replay is created as a service in your pipeline. The service may take some time to load. You can then replay data into your pipeline using the play/pause control, as if it were live data:
