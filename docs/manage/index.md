# Overview

TODO

An entire Quix pipeline can be described by a `quix.yaml` file. This file is also used to configure resources used by the deployment.

This enables Quix to quickly replicate an entire pipeline and configuration. For example, a pipeline created and tested in one branch, can be quickly duplicated in another branch.
