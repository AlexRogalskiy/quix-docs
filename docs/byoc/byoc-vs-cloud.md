    Exclusively. Quix BYOC Enterprise Editions are self-contained. _Only_ you store your data.

    Running your own infrastructure on your premises (or in a co-location) is often more cost-efficient than most cloud offerings. This is particularly true if you have specific hardware requirements that are not easily met in the cloud, such as GPUs, FPGAs, ultra-high-speed storage or networking. However, Quix Cloud remains the best managed experience.

    You may choose to run Quix BYOC in your own cloud environment, consuming reservations or quotas established in prior agreements with cloud providers. This has the potential to lower your operational costs, while maintaining a cloud presence with Quix.
