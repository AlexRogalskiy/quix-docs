# Create an external source

At this point you have an external program sending data into Quix, and it is writing into a Quix topic. However, you can't see this external program in the Pipeline view. To help you visualize what you've created, you can add an external source component, to provide a visual entity in the pipeline view. To do this, log into Quix Cloud:

1. Click on `Code Samples`.
2. Select the `Python`, `Source`, and `Basic templates` filters.
3. On the `External Source` sample, click `Add external source`.
4. Give the component a name, such as "Laptop CPU Load".
5. For output topic select `cpu-load`.
6. Click `Add external source`.

This now appears in the pipeline view as a reminder (visual cue) as to the nature of the source generating the data for this topic, and you can easily add further pipeline services on the output of this source.

Watch a video on adding an external source:

Note, this video is for a different project, but the principle is the same.
