In this tutorial you have learned how to ingest data, using prebuilt code samples for real-time processing, how to view the data in different ways, and how to query the data to enable model training. 

## Code Samples used

Here is a list of the open source Quix Code Samples used in this tutorial, with links to their code in GitHub:

* [New York Bikes](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/NY-Citibikes){target=_blank}
* [VisualCrossing Weather](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/visualcrossing-weather){target=_blank}
* [New York Bikes - Prediction](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/NY-Bikes-Predictions){target=_blank}

## Next steps

Here are some suggested next steps to continue on your Quix learning journey:

* Try the [Event detection tutorial](../event-detection/overview.md).

* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute something to the Code Samples. Visit the [GitHub Code Samples repository](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target=_blank}. Fork our Code Samples repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.

What will you build? Let us know! Quix would like to feature your application or use case in our [newsletter](https://www.quix.io/community/){target=_blank}.
