# Summary

!!! warning

    This tutorial is out of date. Please check the [tutorials overview](../overview.md) for our latest tutorials.

In this tutorial you have learned that it is possible to quickly fork a complete Quix project and get it up and running in your Quix account very quickly. This enables you to start your own project by using one of our templates. You can then modify our code, keeping your project in a public or private Git repository as required. Alternatively, you can build your own custom pipeline from a mix of our code samples, and your own custom sources, transforms, and destinations.

In addition, you have seen how in Quix you can:

* See the power of navigating your pipeline visually
* View the logs of a service as an aid to debugging
* View live data in the application view, or using the Quix Data Explorer
* Learned how you can host your project in a Git repository
* Learn how to examine the raw message data in the messages view
* Examine and edit the code of a service

## Next Steps

Here are some suggested next steps to continue on your Quix learning journey:

* Build something with our [Code Samples](../../develop/code-samples.md).
* Try the [Chat sentiment analysis tutorial](../sentiment-analysis/overview.md).
* Try the [Computer vision tutorial](../computer-vision/overview.md).
* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute something to the Code Samples. Visit the [GitHub Code Samples repository](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target=_blank}. Fork our Code Samples repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.
