# Predictive maintenance

In this tutorial you learn about a project template that demonstrates real-time predictive analytics. It simulates three temperature sensors on a fleet of 3D printers. It predicts temperature for the printers using 

This tutorial uses the [Quix predictive maintenance template project](https://github.com/quixio/template-predictive-maintenance){target=_blank}.

You'll fork the complete project from GitHub, and then create a Quix project from the forked repo, so you have a copy of the full application code running in your Quix account. You then examine the data flow through the project's pipeline, using tools provided by Quix.

## GitHub repository

The complete code for this project can be found in the [Quix GitHub repository](https://github.com/quixio/template-predictive-maintenance){target="_blank"}.

## Getting help

If you need any assistance while following the tutorial, we're here to help in the [Quix Community](https://quix.io/slack-invite){target="_blank"}.

## Prerequisites

To get started make sure you have a [free Quix account](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up).

### InfluxDB

You'll need a [free InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/serverless/){target=_blank} account to try this out in your Quix account.

### Git provider

You also need to have a Git account. This could be GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or any other Git provider you are familar with, and that supports SSH keys. The simplest option is to create a free [GitHub account](){target=_blank}.

!!! tip

    While this tutorial uses an external Git account, Quix can also provide a Quix-hosted Git solution using Gitea for your own projects. You can watch a video on [how to create a project using Quix-hosted Git](https://www.loom.com/share/b4488be244834333aec56e1a35faf4db?sid=a9aa124a-a2b0-45f1-a756-11b4395d0efc){target=_blank}.

## The pipeline

There are several *main* stages in the [pipeline](TODO){target=_blank}:

1. *Data generator* - generates the temperature data for a fleet of 3D printers.
2. *Downsampling* - downsamples data from one second to one minute.
3. *Forecast* - uses the `scikit-learn`library to predict 3D printer temperature.
4. *Alert* -  
5. **

More details are provided on all these services later in the tutorial.

## Topics

The following Kafka topics are present in the project:

| Topic | Description | Producer service | Consumer service(s)
|---|---|---|---|
| `3d-printer-data` | The generated 3D printer temperature data  | Data generator | Downsampling, Printers dahsboard |
| `downsampled-3d-printer-data` | Down samples the data from 1 second to 1 minute | Downsampling | Forecast, InfluxDB raw data |
| `forecast` | Forecast temperature | Forecast | Alert, Printers dashboard |
| `alerts` | Temperature alert | Alert | Printers dashboard, InfluxDB alerts |

## The parts of the tutorial

This tutorial is divided up into several parts, to make it a more manageable learning experience. The parts are summarized here:

1. [Get the project](get-project.md) - you get the project up and running in your Quix account. 

x. [Summary](summary.md). In this concluding part you are presented with a summary of the work you have completed, and also some next steps for more advanced learning about Quix.
