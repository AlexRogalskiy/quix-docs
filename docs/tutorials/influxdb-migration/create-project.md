# Create the project

You first need to have a project in Quix Cloud in order to carry out the migration. There are several options here:

1. Clone the template project from the [gallery page](https://quix.io/templates/sync-data-from-influxdb-v2-to-influxdb-v3){target=_blank}
2. Fork the project from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quixio/template-influxv2-to-v3){target=_blank}
3. Create the project from scratch

In this tutorial you'll learn how to create the project from scratch. 

Read the documentation to learn how to [create a new project](../../create/create-project.md). You can create a project with the default single environment.

!!! tip

    If you already know how to create a Quix project, and just want to use our template project immediately, you can [clone the template](../../create/clone-project.md), and configure each service with your InfluxDB credentials. You can then immediately start migrating your data without needing to complete the rest of this tutorial. If however, you'd like to learn more about Quix, then please proceed to the next (optional) step.
