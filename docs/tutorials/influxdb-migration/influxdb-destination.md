# Add an InfluxDB destination connector

You learned how to do this in the [InfluxDB Quickstart](../../integrations/databases/influxdb/quickstart.md). 

Make sure the input topic to the destination is the same as output of the source connector, `influxdb-v2-data`.

[Configure the connector with your InfluxDB v3 credentials](influxdb-source.md#set-the-environment-variables), which you learned how to do in the previous part.

In addition you need to set the following variables:

| Environment Variable | Description|
|---|---|
| `INFLUXDB_FIELD_KEYS` | These are the columns of rows of data that you want to write to the InfluxDB v3 database. |
| `INFLUXDB_TAG_KEYS` | The metadata that you want to write to the InfluxDB v3 database. |

??? "InfluxDB terminology"

    | InfluxDB | General database |
    |---|---|
    | Bucket | Database |
    | Measurement | Table |
    | Point | Row |
    | Field | Column |
    | Tag | Metadata |

When you've completed the configuration for the connector, deploy it.

Your pipeline now looks like this:

You can now log into your InfluxDB Cloud account and query your bucket for data, to make sure data is being written to the InfluxDB v3 database.
