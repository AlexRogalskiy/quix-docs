# Add an InfluxDB destination connector

You learned how to do this in the [InfluxDB Quickstart](../../integrations/databases/influxdb/quickstart.md). 

Make sure the input topic to the destination is the same as output of the source connector, `influxdb-v2-data`.

Configure the connector with your InfluxDB v3 credentials. Deploy your connector.

Your pipeline now looks like this:

You can now log into your InfluxDB Cloud account and query your bucket for data.
