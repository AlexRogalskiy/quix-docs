# Overview

Welcome to the Quix Tour! 

The Quix Tour is designed to help you build a complete stream processing pipeline with Quix **in less than 20 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

To complete the Quix Tour you'll need the following:

1. Complete the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md).
2. (Optional) A free [Vonage API account](https://developer.vonage.com/sign-up).

## CPU overload detection pipeline

The pipeline you implement in this tour:

1. **Ingest** - you publish data from your laptop into Quix using the Quix client library, Quix Streams. You're going to publish your real-time CPU load. You could alternatively publish data from a CSV file, or any other source required for your use case.

    !!! note

        You completed this part already in the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md).

2. **Process** - in this part, you process your data. Here you create a transform service that performs threshold detection. You publish messages to the transform's output topic. 

3. **Serve** - when you receive a message indicating CPU load has exceeded the threshold you (optionally) send an SMS to the system administrator.

!!! note

    The components in the pipeline are connected together by [Kafka topics](../../kb/what-is-kafka.md).
