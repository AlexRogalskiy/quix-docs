# Overview

[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/){target=_blank} is an open-source time series database. It is used for storage and retrieval of time series and event data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, and real-time analytics.    

Quix currently supports the following connectors for InfluxDB:

* InfluxDB 2.0 source - enables you to get data from InfluxDB v2 into Quix
* InfluxDB 3.0 source - enables you to get data from InfluxDB v3 into Quix
* InfluxDB 3.0 destination - enables you to publish data from Quix into InfluxDB v3

Note if you want to move data from InfluxDB v2 to v3 you could use the v2 source and v3 destination to do this.
