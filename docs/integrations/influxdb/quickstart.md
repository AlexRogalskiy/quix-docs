# Quickstart

This quickstart shows you how to integrate Quix with InfluxDB using our standard [connectors](../../connectors/index.md).

In the first part of this quickstart, you'll publish data generated by a sample source from a Quix topic to InfluxDB, and in the second part you'll publish data from InfluxDB into a Quix topic, and then explore that data in real time.

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart you will need:

* A free [Quix account](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up){target="_blank"}.
* An [InfluxDB account](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/serverless/){target=_blank}

You also need to [create a project](../../create/create-project.md) with an environment.

## Create your InfluxDB bucket

Log into your InfluxDB account and create a new bucket called `f1-data`.

## Obtain your InfluxDB token

In the InfluxDB token manager, generate an API token for this project. All "all access" token can be created. Also provide a useful description such as "Quix Quickstart F1 Data". Save the token securely for later use.

## Create your sample source

To create a sample data source so you have some data to store in InfluxDB:

1. In the pipeline view of your environment, click `+ Sample data source`. 

2. Click `Deploy` and `Deploy` again to add the sample data source into your pipeline.

Alternatively, click `Add new` (top right corner in pipeline view), select `Source`, and then select `Demo Data`. You can then deploy this sample.

By default, the output topic from this sample is `f1-data`.

## Add your InfluxDB destination

You now add an InfluxDB **destination** to enable you to publish data from a Quix topic to InfluxDB.

1. Switch to the pipeline view and click `+ Add new` and select `Destination` - you are now going to add an InfluxDB destination.

2. In the search box type "Influx" and click `Preview code` on the InfluxDB 3.0 connector. Take a note of the environment variables you'll need to set and then click the `Edit code` button.

3. Leave the default Application name and Path and click `Save` to save to your repository.

4. You now need to configure the required environment variables. The input topic is already set for you (`f1-data`):

    ![InfluxDB environment variables](../../images/integrations/influxdb-environment-variables.png)

    !!! tip

        This table shows some example values:

        | Variable | Description |
        |----|----|
        | `input` | This should be set to `f1-data`, if not already set. |
        | `INFLUXDB_HOST` | Your Influx host. Example: `https://us-east-1-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com/` |
        | `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` | Your all-access token generated in Influx. Example: `z7E<snip>Og==` |
        | `INFLUXDB_ORG` | In your Influx account you can see your available organizations. Example: `Docs` |
        | `INFLUXDB_DATABASE` | The InfluxDB bucket, in this case `f1-data` |
        | `INFLUXDB_TAG_COLUMNS` | Leave as default, `['tag1', 'tag2']`. |
        | `INFLUXDB_MEASUREMENT_NAME` | The "table" name, in this case `f1-data`. |

5. Click the `Run` button to test connection with the database. If no errors occur, proceed to the next step, or otherwise check you have configured your environment variables correctly.

6. Click `Deploy` and leave the settings at their defaults to build and deploy your InfluxDB connector. The database will then start receiving data once the build completes.

## Check your data in InfluxDB

You will now check that your InfluxDB database is receiving data. 

1. In InfluxDB switch to the Explorer and in the schema browser select the `f1-data` bucket. 

2. Under `Measurement` select `f1-data` and click `Run`. You can see the stored data:

    ![stored data](../../images/integrations/influxdb-f1-data-results.png)

You have successfully published data from Quix to InfluxDB.

!!! note

    In the second part of this quickstart you learn how to publish data from InfluxDB to Quix.

## Add an InfluxDB source

You now add an InfluxDB **source** to enable you to publish data from InfluxDB to a Quix topic.

1. In the pipeline view, in  the top right click the `Add new` button and then select `Source`.

2. Type "Influx" into the search bar and click `Preview code` for the InfluxDB 3.0 connector.

3. Click `Edit code` accepting the defaults for Application name and path.

4. You now need to configure environment variables, in the same way as you did in the previous section.

    !!! tip
    
        For the default output topic, `influxdb` you need to make sure that topic is created. You can do this once you click edit variable. Accept the defaults in the `New topic` dialog. Also, the database is the bucket you created previously, `f1-data`. The measurement is also `f1-data`.

5. Click the `Run` button to test connection with the database. If no errors occur proceed to the next step, or otherwise check you have configured your environment variables correctly.

6. Click `Deploy` and leave the settings at their defaults to build and deploy your InfluxDB connector. The connector will then publish data from InfluxDB to the Quix output topic once the build completes.

7. Switch back to the pipeline view:

    ![Pipeline view](../../images/integrations/influxdb-pipeline.png)

!!! tip

    The green arrows in the pipeline view indicate data is being received. If no data is being received, the arrows are gray.

## Explore the data from InfluxDB in real time

You can now explore data published from InfluxDB to the Quix topic `influxdb` by the connector.

1. In the main left-hand menu, click on `Data explorer`.

2. Click `Live data`, then select the topic, which is the output topic for the connector, `influxdb`.

3. Select the `influxdb-query` stream.

4. Select the parameters of interest, for example, `Brake`, `EngineRPM`, and `Gear`.

5. Select the Waveform view. The selected data is displayed in real time:

    ![real-time waveform display](../../images/integrations/influxdb-data-explorer.png)

Data is being read from InfluxDB by the Quix connector, and then published to the Quix topic, `influxdb`. The Quix data explorer is then used to display this data in real time.
