# Quix managed broker

The simplest and most convenient choice is to use Quix-managed Kafka. No installation of Kafka is required, and configuration can be done through the Quix UI if you need to change the sensible default values. Very little knowledge of Kafka is expected, beyond basic familiarity with concepts such as [topics](../../get-started/glossary.md#topic).

There is a small charge for storage for messages persisted in a topic.
